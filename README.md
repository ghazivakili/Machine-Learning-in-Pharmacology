# Machine Learning in Pharmacology

This repository contains the lecture material (`teaching_LR_v2.pdf`) and a beginner-friendly Python lab focused on linear regression for pharmacology and pharmacokinetics use cases.

## Contents

- `teaching_LR_v2.pdf` – Slide deck introducing QSAR, linear regression mathematics, and pharmacology examples.
- `pharmacology_linear_regression_lab/` – Complete lab package with data, notebooks, and setup instructions.

## Getting Started

1. Install Python 3.10+.
2. Navigate into `pharmacology_linear_regression_lab/` and follow the README to create a virtual environment, install requirements, and open the notebooks in Jupyter Lab/Notebook.
3. Share the lab folder with students or push it to GitHub/Classroom for distribution.
